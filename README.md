# KB-AudioViz
This project is a canvas based Audio Visualizer. Since this was an older project, my goal is to revisit it and improve it. The project in its current state has the following features:
- Users can choose from 9 provided songs or upload their own music that will last for the session.
- Tempo detection and beat detection which influences particles that move and pulse based on the song being played.
- Custom UI elements including sliders, radio buttons, and audio controls.


Todo List:
- [ ] Clean/Reformat Code.
- [ ] Migrate to React.
- [ ] Change upload function to store songs to a database so they can persist.
- [ ] Migrate to PixiJS? There might be some other interesting effects we can achieve with this.
